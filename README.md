# JavaCamp_Day2
Profile and course are objects in the Kodlama.io. I choosed them and created their classes and constructors, after that i added them in the arrays and then printed their names.
ProductManager has simple 2 methods, adding course and removing course. I also added extra the number of total course. It is changing according to methods.
